This is a simple little application that let's you view your KML on a Google Map.

It is created in Python using the Google App Engine framework.  

You can view this in action at display-kml.appspot.com

Feel free to copy this application and use it yourself!  (Note: the index.html includes my Google Analytics script.  Also you'll have to change the Google Map Key in display_kml.py)
